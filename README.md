## Project Overview

KeySpark is a single-page application designed to help users master VS Code keyboard shortcuts through interactive exercises. The core functionality to load different difficulty levels, present exercises with detailed prompts, and validate user keyboard input against expected shortcuts is fully implemented. Users receive immediate visual feedback based on the correctness of their actions.

The application supports beginner to advanced level exercises, featuring a dynamic exercise loading system and validation that ensures accurate recognition of key combinations.

## Features Implemented

- Dynamic loading of exercise prompts based on difficulty levels.
- Keyboard input detection and validation of complex shortcut combinations.
- Visual feedback system indicating success or failure of user interactions.

---

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for application logic and event handling.
- **HTML5** for structuring the single-page interface.
- **CSS3** for styling and visual feedback (currently a work in progress).

---

## Current Status

While the core logic and interactive functionality are complete, the applicationâ€™s styling and user interface design are still being refined. Future updates will focus on enhancing the user experience, improving layout, and adding polish to visual elements and adding more Levels.

## Getting Started

To run the application, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. No backend or database setup is required, as all data is loaded locally through static JSON files.
